## Overview ðŸ§ 

Shared package defining all OneDrive read/write ETL modules used across the modelling package and 5 cron task packages.

**Usage Notes**:
- When testing a single task (e.g., `modelling` in `dev1`), ensure `runOnStartup` is set to `False` for the other 4 tasks.
- For faster testing, lines 36â€“37 in `advAnalyticsModel.py` are commented out. Uncomment before merging into `main`.
- `advAnalyticsModel.py` defines the base class for modelling. Other models inherit from it and override abstract methods.
